					<p class="education">It is believed that 25-40% of food created for consumption in the U.S. wonâ€™t actually be eaten.</p>
					<p class="education">Food waste and mitigation efforts differ based on the industry/how large a company or organization is. <br>
			Manufacturers donate less food for human consumption and more food for animal feed and composting.<br>
			Retail and wholesale businesses donate more food for human consumption
			2016 Survey found that 25% of diverted food from this sector was classified as unsaleable and donated for human consumption
			Greatest barrier cited in this sector for not donating more was transportation issues (over 40%)
			</p>
			<p class="education">Restaurants diverted more food waste to recycling it as bio-based materials (60%)
			Serious barrier to donating food for human consumption is that much of their waste comes from leftover food that had already been served. 
			Other barriers cited included insufficient onsite refrigeration and storage capabilities as well as transportation and liability concerns. 
			A possible solution with FoodX is educating those on the Good Samaritan Act and removing that barrier of transportation, refrigeration, and storage by creating real-time access to food donations. 
			</p>
			<p class="education">Reducing food waste by individuals is also important and there are many small steps that can be taken, including:
				Shopping for food from your refrigerator
			   Knowing the difference between use by, sell by, and best by dates and planning around those. 
			   Proper storage of produce and other perishable items to ensure they last longer
               The easiest tip is to plan your meals so that as much of your food gets used as possible
