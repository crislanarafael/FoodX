## Developers
Created by rislana Rafael and Rebecca Zuick as project submission for Hydrangea Hacks 2021. <br><br> **June 22, 2021 Update:** FoodX was one of the winning submissions at Hydrangea Hacks and winner of the Qoom Track out of 84 other projects and 701 hackers. We're excited to expand upon our project in the near future! :tada::tada::tada:

## Project Inspiration
2020 being a difficult year is a _severe_ understatement. While many people struggled with accepting the significance of COVID-19, many other people struggled with other issues such as joblessness, homelessness, and food insecurity. The concept behind **FoodX** is to solve food insecurity by making it easier to connect those who have food to donate with those who need food. Through **FoodX** we will try to dramatically decrease the amount of food that ends up in U.S. landfills every year. When our users connect via **FoodX**, they help solve the problem of food waste while also strengthening ties to their local communities. With **FoodX** we can do more than survive. We can thrive.

Our name comes from a play on words of FedEx and Food exchange. Like the transportation company, we feel that **FoodX** can be a great and effective delivery method for facilitating food exchange.

## What this project does
**FoodX** facilitates food donation. It's that simple. Some of the largest hurdles to donating food identified by restaurants and retail/wholesale grocery facilities is a worry about liability as well as the transportation and storage of donated foods. **FoodX** solves this problem by allowing donors and recipients to communicate as directly as possible. The ease of this build is that it can connect the users in a very short time, thus eliminating the transportation and storage issues. **FoodX** also educates users on ways to reduce food waste and the legalities around food donation in the United States.


## Why this project is useful
Food is useful because it aims to build community ties while helping reduce the environmental impacts of food waste. **FoodX**, a website that aims to reduce food waste and increase food recycling and sustainability. At FoodX we aim to connect restaurants, grocery stores, and well-meaning individuals who have an excess of unused, uneaten, and unexpired food at the end of the day with those individuals and families who are food insecure. 

## How we built this 
The lifecycle of our project began with the logo. Crislana created the **FoodX** logo with an understated reference to the logo of a popular package delivery service. The idea behind this was that, by  acting as an intermediary between providers and recipients, **FoodX** will deliver a resource to reduce food waste and food insecurity.

As neither of us had much experience with coding full projects on the back or front-end, we decided to use a platform that would best assist us in making the project, which is how we chose Qoom. From there, Crislana focused on creating an accessible and aesthetically pleasing design and layout for the website. She used HTML to create an interactive user experience and further used Qoom's built-in database function to store the user data to access it later, when needed for the chat function.

While Crislana focused on the user experience and enhancing the aesthetics of the webpage, Rebecca continued research into specific facts surrounding food waste, food recycling, and food donation. Rebecca also researched information on the ways individuals could behave to also help minimize food waste. As a secondary goal of this project is to educate people on how to reduce food waste, it was necessary to research these topics and find a way to seamlessly integrate it into the webpage.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 

We are most proud of our communication throughout the weekend of this hackathon as well as the fact that we were able to create a project that works the way we intended. We were in different time zones and didn't form our team until the last possible moment on the first day of the hackathon. Despite that, we were able to collaborate well with each other. The functionality of our webpage is also something we are proud of because of just how much we learned this weekend.

## What is next for this project
We would like to see **FoodX** scaled significantly. We initially created this project with a very local location in mind. To assist in scaling the project we would possibly need to create more specific filtering methods. We may want to integrate a map into the program so that users can filter respondents and be matched via their location to ensure local donations. Scaling this project could also involve adding additional types of donations, such as donating for food recycling/composting instead of for human consumption.
